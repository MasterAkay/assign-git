What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast forwarding in git occurs when the master and the side branch merge to form a linear master branch due to no changes in the master throughout the occurance of the side branch.

Why should you have different branches?
we need different branches to indicate different stages of development. For example the master branch must contain the working code while the branches
can be used by the developers to development enhancements or continous upgrades.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
one repository must be used, the master branch must have the working code while the branches can be used my developers and team members to build upon.
